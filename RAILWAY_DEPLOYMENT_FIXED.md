# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Fixed Issues

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

1. **Removed husky dependency** - Was causing npm install to fail
2. **Fixed start script** - Now uses `server/index.js` instead of `dist/`
3. **Removed prepare script** - No longer runs husky install
4. **Simplified package.json** - Removed problematic dependencies

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway (Fixed Version)**

### **Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app
2. **Login** with GitHub
3. **Select your project**: nfl-aggregator
4. **Click "Deploy"** - Railway will automatically:
   - Pull the latest code from GitHub
   - Install dependencies (no more husky errors)
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Deploy your application

### **Method 2: Railway CLI (If you want to try again)**

```bash
# Link to your project
railway link

# Set environment variables
railway variables --set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables --set PORT=5000
railway variables --set JWT_SECRET=nfl-aggregator-super-secret-jwt-key-2024
railway variables --set BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
railway variables --set RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
railway variables --set RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
railway variables --set LOG_LEVEL=info

# Deploy
railway up
```

## 🎯 **What's Fixed**

- ✅ **No more husky errors** during npm install
- ✅ **Correct start script** for Railway
- ✅ **Simplified dependencies** for better compatibility
- ✅ **Updated code** pushed to GitHub

## 📊 **Expected Result**

Your NFL Aggregator should now deploy successfully with:
- **Live URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Automatically linked
- **All API Endpoints**: Working
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint
- **Teams API**: `/api/teams`
- **Games API**: `/api/games`

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployment**

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Teams API
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/teams

# Games API
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/games
```

## 🎉 **Success!**

The deployment should now work without the previous errors. Your NFL Aggregator will be live and fully functional!

**Try deploying again - it should work now! 🏈**
